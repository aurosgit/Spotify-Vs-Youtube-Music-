#Objective
This project analyzes a combined dataset of Spotify and YouTube music data to uncover insights into song performance, artist popularity, and platform-specific trends. By using SQL queries, we explore:

✅ Engagement Trends – Which platform (Spotify or YouTube) generates more views, likes, and streams?
✅ Revenue Estimations – How much revenue do artists potentially earn from both platforms?
✅ Song Characteristics – Do high-energy, fast-paced, or longer-duration songs perform better?
✅ Artist & Album Impact – Which artists dominate the charts, and which albums contribute most to their success?
✅ Correlation Analysis – Do songs with more likes also get more comments? Does YouTube popularity impact Spotify streams?
